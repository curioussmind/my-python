# lists are mutable and indexed by int starting from 0
# list and tuple are quiet similar but different, the obvious different is that tuple uses paranthesis but list uses square brackets

colors = ["red", "blue", "yellow", "green"] # creatinng list literal

list((1, 2, 3)) # creating list using list() built in function.

list("python") # creating list from string

groceries = "egges, milk, cheese"
grocery_list = groceries.split(", ") # creating list using split() method

"a;b;c".split(";") # >> ['a', 'b', 'c']
